			- Geological Exploration(Talent 1) increases the duration of slow marginally. This is generally too small of a change to matter, so dont bother. 
			- Quicksand(Skill 2) causes Earthspirit to stop attacking enemies and slow all enemies in range every once in a while. This skill is turbo garbage, just use a different Decel Binder please.

	- Skadi The Corrupting Heart
		- Wish of Burial Beyond the Light(Skill 2) is the general use ability for Skalter as it replaces the need for a healer in a large area along with buffing allies. 
		- The Tide Surges, The Tide Recedes(Skill 3) is also very important as it does a high amount of true damage at the cost of Skalter's Health, make sure to heal her when using Skill 3 unless you are fine with her dying. 
		- Her seaborn extends her range of her abilities which is beneficial for both abilities.
